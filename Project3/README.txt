The below deliverables are included:
1. MachineLearningLabReport3 is the write-up with full analysis of our algorithm and experiments
2. MachineLearningDemo3 is the 5 minute (4:58 to be exact) video demonstrating the required functionality of the code
3. Source code
	a. All of the data sets have their own main to run their respective experiments. Each has its own tune and test sections which can be run separately due to the logging 	put into place. They are labeled "MLProject3[DataSetName]".
	b. NeuralNetworkClass contains our constructors and functions related to tree creation
	c. DataML3 is the data pipeline created to source and manipulate data as needed
	d. AuxML3 is any auxillary functions leveraged throughout the workflows
4. Each data set has its own folder that holds its data outputs. It is also where the raw data is stored locally. There may be multiple labeled with the time stamp of when the respective experiment started, but the sub-folder labeled with the relevant network type will have its own "FinalOutputs"
