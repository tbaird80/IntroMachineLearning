The below deliverables are included:
1. MachineLearningLabReport1 is the write-up with full analysis of our algorithm and experiments
2. MachineLearningDemo1 is the 5 minute (4:59 to be exact) video demonstrating the required functionality of the code
3. Source code
	a. All of the data sets have their own main to run their respective experiments. Each has its own tune and test sections which can be run separately due to the logging put into place. They are labeled "MLProject1[DataSetName]".
	b. DataML1 is the data pipeline created to source and manipulate data as needed
	c. AuxML1 is any auxillary functions leveraged throughout the workflows
	d. KNNTuningML1 is the function that performs the tuning of hyperparameters
	e. KNNTestML1 is the function that runs our final test once our tuned hyperparameters have been chosen.
4. Each data set has its own folder that holds its data outputs. There may be multiple labeled with the time stamp of when the respective experiment started, but the folder labeled "KEEPTestCases" is the one used for analysis within write-up. It is also where the raw data is stored locally.
